Inst-Sticky is an advanced slime, it is extremely sticky, just like the bird glue trap, you can feel the resistance on your body, beautiful lace between you and your partner, and get extremely slippery by adding more water! One recipe with two different play! (20L or 30L per bag is good for slippery wrestling or water sport.)

Beware that Inst-Sticky is an advanced slime, it needs more experience in cleaning, please prepare more time and energy for cleaning, we suggest you have tried Inst-Slime before Inst-Sticky.

Guide for making slime
---
* Prepare 10L of clean water in a bucket.
  * Choose the comfort temperature you want (like taking bath), DO NOT use hot water to avoid scald.
  * DO NOT use less than 5L of water to avoid agglomerate.
  * DO NOT use slime to replace clean water, it will cause agglomerate.
  * Add the dye for coloring now if you want.
* Stir the water with hands or tools to make it spin.
* Open Inst-Sticky package, sprinkle into the water while stirring continuously for about two minutes to fully absorb and swell in water, then enjoy.


Concentration/Temperature Adjustment
---
* If you want to be thicker: follow the mixing guide and add five liters of water to the bucket in-stand, but it is not recommended to use less than five liters.
* If you want a little lighter/hotter: follow the recipe guide and add hot water after fully thickening to the desired concentration/temperature.

Body cleaning
---
* Generally, we suggest reserving 30-60min for bath & cleaning.
* Scraping off the large pieces of slime will greatly simplify the difficulty of cleaning.
* If the slime sticks to the skin, it can be effectively scraped off with bath balls.
* When the bath ball gets sticky, can continue using it by rubbing the bath ball with water.
* Soap can effectively prevent the washed mucus from sticking back to your body.
* Warm water can speed up the flushing of mucus.
* A tub full of warm water for scrubbing the body can quickly remove mucus.


Environment cleaning
---
* Diluted the slime with water then drained it into the ditch. This slime uses earth-friendly materials and can be decomposed in the natural environment.
* If the slime is thick, the toilet is a bigger pipe for draining, but still recommended to dilute the slime first.
* For the sticky floors, you can use Sodium Percarbonate makes brushing easier. Sprinkle on the floor with sodium percarbonate and wait 5-10 minutes.
* Clothes can be washed in the washing machine (recommended washing separately from ordinary clothes).
  * Soaking and rubbing in hot water can help greatly.
  * If not easy to clean, use hot water to soak the "sodium percarbonate", soak the clothes for five minutes or more, and then wash them normally. NOTE: Avoid using this on fragile clothes, may cause color fade!

Environment cleaning
---
* Diluted the slime with water then drained it into the ditch. This slime uses earth-friendly materials and can be decomposed in the natural environment.
* If the slime is thick, the toilet is a bigger pipe for draining, but still recommended dilute the slime first.
* For the sticky floors, you can use Sodium Percarbonate makes brushing easier. Sprinkle on the floor with sodium percarbonate and wait 5-10 minutes.
* Clothes can be washed in the washing machine (recommended washing separately from ordinary clothes).
  * Soaking and rubbing in hot water can help greatly.
  * If not easy to clean, use hot water to soak the "sodium percarbonate", soak the clothes for five minutes or more, and then wash them normally. NOTE: Avoid using this on fragile clothes, may cause color fade!
